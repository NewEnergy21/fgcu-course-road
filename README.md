# FGCU Course Road

The static app is hosted here: [FGCU Course Road](https://newenergy21.github.io/fgcu-course-road/)

This was a project from several years ago when I was learning front end skillsets. The app is a static webpage designed to help students navigate their undergraduate course requirements in order to target graduating on time (in this particular case, the university used for the case study was Florida Gulf Coast University). At a high level, the concept was inspired by [MIT's Course Road](https://courseroad.mit.edu/road/$defaultroad$) (see the [GitHub here](https://github.com/venkatesh-sivaraman/fireroad-server) and the original [CourseRoad repo](https://github.com/dannybd/courseroad)).

The app doesn't highlight the best design practices since it was more of a learning experience - it's entirely client side, and the database is embedded in a static JavaScript file rather than served from a database. I later built on this project in a small startup effort, which is not public on GitHub. That project cleaned up the front end a lot with `jQuery` and CSS frameworks like [Pure.css](https://purecss.io/), used `Flask` to host, and served data from a `PostgreSQL` database.
